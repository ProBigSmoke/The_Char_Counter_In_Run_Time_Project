# data_type_project_in_multiply_files
ABOUT THE PROJECT : This project is a C++ progeram that can get a string but you have a char counter that counte your strings chars in run time and shows the value of it in run time .
The main function of this project get_input_from_user(std::string); in get_input_with_char_counter.cpp file with parameter in string type that you use that to ask the user what data do you want.
The return type of the get_input_from_user(std::string); is void because the project is still unfinished but you can see what input did you enter when you enter the enter key.
HOW RUN THE PROGERAM : Just simply call the get_input_from_user in main function with str in expression or a string type input be sure to have a conio.h and windows.h directory
NOTE : This project isn't write for any any purpose and its just only C++ training by armature programmer
